## About
SwiftHTTP is a DSL that offers a declarative spin to networking and a simpler way to interact with the built in URLSession. This package offers a 
similarity in syntax to SwiftUI with the intention of making it very easy to read and write network requests just as views are within the bounds 
of SwiftUI.

## Installation
`SwiftHTTP` can be installed via `SPM`.

In Xcode go to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...` and add `https://github.com/dylanjrafferty/SwiftHTTP`

## Getting Started

First import the package to your file

`import SwiftHTTP`

Once the package has been imported, you can use it to create network requests with a declarative and SwiftUI like feel.
